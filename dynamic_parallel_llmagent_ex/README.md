# Dynamic Parallel Agent Example

This example demonstrates a potential agent pattern for processing a dynamic list of tasks in parallel using a fixed-size pool of worker agents. The root agent orchestrates a pipeline that first asks the user for text input, splits that input into a list of words, and then uses the dynamic parallel pattern to count the characters of each word concurrently. Here's my understanding on [why this is needed](#why-is-this-pattern-needed).

## How to Run

Complete all these steps from the root directory of the repo.

### 1. Setup

First, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

This agent uses the Gemini API. You will need to set your Google API key as an environment variable. Create a `.env` file:

**.env**
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Google API key.

### 3. Run the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK CLI. Running the following command will start a web-based development UI where you can interact with the agent:

```bash
adk web
```

Select `dynamic_parallel_llmagent_ex` in the top left of the web UI.

Type any text as input and the agent will calculate the total number of characters (not including spaces) in those words. Here's some text to copy:

```bash
Android 16 is now rolling out on Pixel devices, with a fresh design and new features like live delivery and ride-share updates
```

## Core Functionality

The primary agent in this example is the [`dynamic_parallel_llmagent`](subagents/dynamic_parallel_llmagent/agent.py), which uses a `LoopAgent` to wrap a `ParallelAgent` and execute a batch of tasks (`WorkerLlmAgent`) in parallel from a queue. It is designed to solve the problem: how to process a list of tasks where the number of tasks is unknown beforehand and may be larger than the number of parallel workers you can or want to run.

The agent pipeline is as follows:
1.  **Task Input**: An `LlmAgent` (`task_input_agent`) prompts the user for input and processes it into a list of strings (words).  This agent is just one example way to get a dynamic list of "tasks" into the session state.
2.  **Task Planning**: A `TaskPlannerAgent` takes this list and initializes a task queue in the session state.
3.  **Batch Processing Loop**: A `LoopAgent` (`task_batch_manager`) repeatedly executes a batch processing cycle until the task queue is empty.
    - **Termination Check**: A `TerminationChecker` agent checks if the queue is empty and stops the loop if it is.
    - **Task Distribution**: A `TaskDistributorAgent` takes a "batch" of tasks from the queue (up to the maximum number of workers) and assigns them to the worker agents.
    - **Parallel Execution**: A `ParallelAgent` (`worker_pool`) runs a fixed number of `WorkerLlmAgent`s concurrently. Each worker picks up its assigned task, processes it (in this case, gets the definition of the word), and writes the result back to the session state.
4.  **Result Aggregation**: Once the loop terminates, a `TaskAggregatorAgent` collects all the individual results and computes a final summary (the total character count).

## Why is this pattern needed?

The base Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides powerful components for building agentic workflows, including the `ParallelAgent` for concurrent execution. However, the `ParallelAgent` is designed to run a *predefined, static list* of sub-agents. It does not natively support scenarios where you have a *dynamic list* of work items that you want to distribute among a smaller, fixed-size pool of workers.

This `dynamic_parallel_llmagent` pattern addresses that gap by providing a reusable architecture for **dynamic task distribution and batch processing**.

### Limitations of Base ADK Components Addressed:

1.  **Static vs. Dynamic Parallelism**:
    - **`ParallelAgent` (Base ADK)**: Requires you to define the exact agents to be run in parallel at design time. It's perfect for when you have a fixed number of known, concurrent operations.
    - **This Pattern**: Handles a dynamic list of tasks (e.g., processing N files in a folder, where N is unknown). It creates a fixed pool of M workers and uses a loop to process all N tasks in batches of M, making it highly scalable and efficient.

2.  **Resource Management**:
    - **`ParallelAgent` (Base ADK)**: If you tried to create a new agent for every single task in a large list, you could quickly overwhelm system resources (e.g., memory, API rate limits).
    - **This Pattern**: Manages resources effectively by using a fixed-size worker pool. You can control the maximum degree of parallelism (`MAX_WORKERS`) to match the capacity of your system, preventing overload while still benefiting from concurrent processing.

3.  **Orchestration Logic**:
    - **Base ADK**: Provides the building blocks (`LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `SequentialAgent`).
    - **This Pattern**: Demonstrates how to combine these blocks with custom `BaseAgent`s for state management to create a sophisticated, stateful orchestration pipeline. It explicitly manages a task queue, distributes work, and aggregates resultsâ€”logic that is not encapsulated in a single base ADK component but is crucial for many real-world applications.

## Known Issues

#### Input Validation error

Sometimes `task_input_agent` does not return the array in the correct format.  In this case, the UI will say 'No tasks to process' and you will see `{"error": "1 validation error for Event}`. Just try again with another phrase. (Note that `task_input_agent` is not part of the pattern itself - it is just a quick way to get a dynamic list of strings into session state so that they can be processed.)

#### Failed to detach context

The agent runs successfully and completes the tasks using `adk web`. However, there is one "Failed to detach context" opentelemmetry error in the logs for each worker.
These errors do not stop or interrupt agent execution or the web interface, but need to be resolved. Possibly related to this [open issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/issues/2606).
